This repository only supports the Salesforce CLI plugin testkit library. If you have identified a bug that is not related to this library but instead to the Salesforce CLI or the force commands please submit your issue to the forcedotcom/cli repo not this one.

If you have a question or are stuck and need help moving forward with the Salesforce CLI please go to the SalesforceDX Trailblazer community https://success.salesforce.com/_ui/core/chatter/groups/GroupProfilePage?g=0F93A000000HTp1 to post a question or submit a case with Salesforce support
